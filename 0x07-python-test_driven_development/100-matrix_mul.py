"""This module defines a function for matrix multiplication"""


def matrix_mul(m_a, m_b):
    """
    Multiply two matrices.
    The function takes two matrices represented as lists of lists and returns
    their product as a list of lists. It also performs input validation and
    raises appropriate errors for invalid input or incompatible matrices.

    Args:
        m_a (list of lists): The first matrix represented as a list of lists.
        m_b (list of lists): The second matrix represented as a list of lists.

    Returns:
        list of lists: The result of matrix multiplication as a list of lists.

    Raises:
        Raise a TypeError:
        - If either m_a or m_b is not a list or if they are not lists of lists
        - If any element in m_a or m_b is not an integer or a float.
        - If the rows in m_a or m_b are not of the same size.
        - If m_a and m_b cannot be multiplied due to incompatible dimensions.
        Raise a ValueError:
        - If either m_a or m_b is empty or contains empty rows.
